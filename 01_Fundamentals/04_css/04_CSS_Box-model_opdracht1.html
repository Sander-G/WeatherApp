    <p>Opdracht 1</p>
        <ul><li>Wat zijn de eigenschappen van block boxes en inline boxes?</li>
            <h3>Block</h3>
            <p>If a box has an outer display type of block, it will behave in the following ways:<br>

              <li> The box will break onto a new line.</li>
                <li>The box will extend in the inline direction to fill the space available in its container.</li>

               <li>In most cases this means that the box will become as wide as its container, filling up 100% of the space available.</li>
                
            <li>The width and height properties are respected.</li>
                <li>Padding, margin and border will cause other elements to be pushed away from the box.</li>
                <br>
                Some HTML elements, such as h1 and p, use block as their outer display type by default. </p>
            
                <h3>Inline</h3>
<p>If a box has an outer display type of inline, then:<br>

   <li> The box will not break onto a new line.</li>
    <li>The width and height properties will not apply.</li>
    <li>Vertical padding, margins, and borders will apply but will not cause other inline boxes to move away from the box.</li>
    <li>Horizontal padding, margins, and borders will apply and will cause other inline boxes to move away from the box.</li>
    <br>
    Some HTML elements, such as a, span, em and strong use inline as their outer display type by default.<br><br>
</ul>   
    The type of box applied to an element is defined by display property values such as block and inline, and relates to the outer value of display.</p>
