    <h3>Opdracht 1</h3>
De belangrijkste waardes van “position” zijn static, relative, absolute, fixed & sticky. Leg voor elke uit wat ze doen.
<ul><li>static:</li>
    
    <p>The element is positioned according to the normal flow of the document. <br>The top, right, bottom, left, and z-index properties have no effect.<br> This is the default value.</p>
<li>relative:</li>
<p>The element is positioned according to the normal flow of the document,<br> and then offset relative to itself based on the values of top, right, bottom, and left.<br> The offset does not affect the position of any other elements; thus,<br> the space given for the element in the page layout is the same as if position were static.</p>

<li>absolute:</li>
<p>The element is removed from the normal document flow,<br> and no space is created for the element in the page layout.<br> It is positioned relative to its closest positioned ancestor, if any;<br> otherwise, it is placed relative to the initial containing block.<br> Its final position is determined by the values of top, right, bottom, and left.</p>
<li>fixed:</li>
<p>The element is removed from the normal document flow, and no space is created for the element in the page layout.<br> 
    Its final position is determined by the values of top, right, bottom, and left.  
</p>
<li>sticky:</li>
<p>The element is positioned according to the normal flow of the document,<br> and then offset relative to its nearest scrolling ancestor and containing block (nearest block-level ancestor),<br> including table-related elements, based on the values of top, right, bottom, and left.<br> The offset does not affect the position of any other elements.</p>

</ul>
