  <h3>Opdracht 1</h3>
  <p>
    Er zijn 14 verschillende pseudo-elementen.<br>
    Beschrijf ze alle 14 kort en maak voor elk een voorbeeld.</p>
  <br>
  <p>A CSS pseudo-element is a keyword added to a selector that lets you style a specific part of the selected
    element(s). <br>
    For example, ::first-line can be used to change the font of the first line of a paragraph.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <h4>::after (:after)</h4>
      <p>In CSS, ::after creates a pseudo-element that is the last child of the selected element.<br> It is often used
        to add cosmetic content to an element with the content property. It is inline by default.</p>

    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>::backdrop</h4>

      <p>The ::backdrop CSS pseudo-element is a box the size of the viewport which is rendered immediately<br> beneath
        any
        element being presented in fullscreen mode.<br> This includes both elements which have been placed in fullscreen
        mode using the Fullscreen API and dialog elements.<br>

        <br>When multiple elements have been placed into fullscreen mode, the backdrop is drawn immediately beneath<br>
        the frontmost such element, and on top of the older fullscreen elements.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>::before (:before)</h4>
      <p>
        In CSS, ::before creates a pseudo-element that is the first child of the selected element.<br>
        It is often used to add cosmetic content to an element with the content property.<br> It is inline by default.
      </p>

    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>::cue</h4>
      <p>The ::cue CSS pseudo-element matches WebVTT cues within a selected element.<br>
        This can be used to style captions and other cues in media with VTT tracks.<br>
        The properties are applied to the entire set of cues as if they were a single unit. <br>
        The only exception is that background and its longhand properties apply to each cue individually,<br>
        to avoid creating boxes and obscuring unexpectedly large areas of the media.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>::cue-region</h4>
      <p>The ::cue-region CSS pseudo-element matches WebVTT cues within a selected element.<br>
        This can be used to style captions and other cues in media with VTT tracks.<br>
        The properties are applied to the entire set of cues as if they were a single unit.<br>
        The only exception is that background and its longhand properties apply to each cue individually,<br>
        to avoid creating boxes and obscuring unexpectedly large areas of the media.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h4>::first-letter (:first-letter)</h4>
      <p>The ::first-letter CSS pseudo-element applies styles to the first letter of the first line of a block-level
        element,<br>
        but only when not preceded by other content (such as images or inline tables).</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h4>::first-line (:first-line)</h4>
      <p>The ::first-line CSS pseudo-element applies styles to the first line of a block-level element.<br>
        The effects of ::first-line are limited by the length and content of the first line of text in the element.<br>
        The length of the first line depends on many factors, including the width of the element, the width of the
        document,<br>
        and the font size of the text. ::first-line has no effect when the first child of the element,<br>
        which would be the first part of the first line, is an inline block-level element, such as an inline table.</p>
    </li>
    <li><h4>::file-selector-button</h4><p>The ::file-selector-button CSS pseudo-element represents the button of an &lt;input&gt; of type="file".</p></li>

    <li><h4>::grammar-error</h4>
    <p>
      The ::grammar-error CSS pseudo-element represents a text segment which the user agent has flagged as grammatically incorrect.
    </p></li>

    <li><h4>::marker</h4>
    <p>
      The ::marker CSS pseudo-element selects the marker box of a list item, which typically contains a bullet or number.<br> 
      It works on any element or pseudo-element set to display: list-item, such as the &lt;li&gt; and &lt;summary&gt; elements.
    </p></li>
<li><h4>::part()</h4>
<p>The ::part CSS pseudo-element represents any element within a shadow tree that has a matching part attribute.</p></li>

<li><h4>::placeholder</h4>
<p>The ::placeholder CSS pseudo-element represents the placeholder text in an &lt;input&gt; or &lt;textarea&gt;  element.<br>
  Only the subset of CSS properties that apply to the ::first-line pseudo-element can be used in a rule using ::placeholder in its selector.</p></li>


<li><h4>::selection</h4>
<p>The ::selection CSS pseudo-element applies styles to the part of a document that has been highlighted by the user<br>
   (such as clicking and dragging the mouse across text).</p>
  <p>
   Only certain CSS properties can be used with ::selection:<br>
<br>
   color<br>
   background-color<br>
   text-decoration and its associated properties<br>
   text-shadow<br>
   stroke-color, fill-color and stroke-width<br><br>
   In particular, background-image is ignored.</p></li>
<li><h4>::slotted()</h4><p>
  The ::slotted() CSS pseudo-element represents any element that has been placed into a slot inside an HTML template<br>
   (see Using templates and slots for more information).<br>
<br>
This only works when used inside CSS placed within a shadow DOM.<br> 
Note also that this selector won't select a text node placed into a slot; it only targets actual elements.<br>
</p></li>

<li><h4>::spelling-error</h4>
<p>The ::spelling-error CSS pseudo-element represents a text segment which the user agent has flagged as incorrectly spelled.</p></li>
  </ul>
